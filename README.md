# Concurrency and Parallelism for beginners
> PyCon 2020 Tutorial 👉

This is the code for my PyCon 2020 online tutorial about concurrency and parallelism using Python

This tutorial provides a complete overview of what is concurrency (and parallelism) and how to create concurrent programs using multithreading and multiprocessing with Python. I'm also focused on including all the important background information required to understand concurrency, for example: Computer Architecture, Operating Systems concepts, etc.

#### How to use this code

Just fire up your favorite Jupyter Notebook server (jupyterlab recommended) and load the notebooks in sequence. The recorded video includes a step by step explanation of each notebook, but it should be possible to follow just from the code.
